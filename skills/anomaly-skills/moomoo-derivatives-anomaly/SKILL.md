# Derivatives Anomaly Skill

Detects derivatives anomalies for a specific stock and formats the result as a structured derivatives anomaly summary.

This skill is for **anomaly detection** rather than a regular derivatives overview. If the data has no qualifying anomaly, return `No anomaly` or `No anomaly (brief reason)`, and do not add extra market commentary.

If the user only says a broad request such as `英伟达异动`, `NVDA 异动`, `腾讯有没有异常` and does not specify a dimension, treat it as a bundled anomaly request. In that case, this skill should be used as one of the three default anomaly skills together with `technical-anomaly` and `capital-anomaly`.

---

## CLI: Version Update Check

Embed the version check into the skill's **single Bash call**. **Do not create any separate tool call** for the version check.

Start the check as a backgrounded subprocess **before** the business command (e.g. `curl`), then append `wait` **after** the business command to collect the result, all in one invocation:

```bash
moomoo-skills check --quiet 2>/dev/null | grep '^moomoo-derivatives-anomaly' > /tmp/.moomoo-derivatives-anomaly-update 2>/dev/null & curl -sG '...' ...; wait; cat /tmp/.moomoo-derivatives-anomaly-update 2>/dev/null; rm -f /tmp/.moomoo-derivatives-anomaly-update
```

Based on the `cat` output:

- **No content** (skill is up-to-date, or `moomoo-skills` not installed, or check failed): do not show any upgrade prompt.
- **Has content** (this skill has an update available): append a notice at the **end** of your reply:
  > `moomoo-derivatives-anomaly` has a new version available. If you agree, I can upgrade it for you right away.

  If the user agrees, run `moomoo-skills upgrade moomoo-derivatives-anomaly` to perform the upgrade.

If `moomoo-skills` is not installed or the check encounters any error, silently skip without affecting normal skill execution.

**Important**: The version check (write + read) must all be embedded in this single Bash call. Do not produce any additional tool calls.

<!-- This section follows docs/templates/opend-prerequisite.md. Keep it in sync with that template. -->

## Prerequisite: OpenD Must Be Running

This skill depends on moomoo **OpenD** (default `127.0.0.1:11111`) to fetch derivatives anomaly data. OpenD installation and startup are owned by the peer `install-moomoo-opend` skill — do **not** attempt to detect, install, or start OpenD from inside this skill.

### Pre-flight Check

Silently probe OpenD reachability before the workflow. **Do not announce this step to the user.**

```bash
nc -z 127.0.0.1 11111 && echo ok || echo not-running
```

Behavior:

- **`ok`** — proceed straight to the Workflow. Do not mention OpenD or the pre-flight check; the user does not need to see it.
- **`not-running`** — ask the user for consent in one short, friendly line, e.g.:
  > This skill needs the local OpenD service (127.0.0.1:11111) to fetch derivatives anomaly data, but it isn't reachable. Want me to install / start it now via `/install-moomoo-opend`?
  - If the user agrees, hand off by invoking `/install-moomoo-opend`. Resume this skill's Workflow once OpenD is reachable.
  - If the user declines, stop here — do **not** execute `scripts/handle_derivatives_anomaly.py`.

> **Hard rule**: When OpenD is not running, **do not execute `scripts/handle_derivatives_anomaly.py` directly**. Hand off to `/install-moomoo-opend` first.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Parse User Input

Extract the following from the user's request:

- `stock_target`: stock code, Chinese stock name, English company name, or ticker explicitly mentioned by the user
- `time_range`: default `7`; if the user says `最近 3 天` / `过去两周` / `last 5 days`, convert it to a natural-day integer
- `analysis_dimensions`: optional; only extract when the user clearly asks about one or more specific derivatives dimensions
- `language_id`: infer from the user's language

If the target stock is missing, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.

### 2. Normalize the Stock Target into a Standard Symbol

Before calling the script, convert the user-mentioned stock target into a standard symbol such as `US.NVDA`, `HK.00700`, `SH.600519`, or `SZ.000001`.

Normalization rules:

- If the user already gives a fully qualified symbol like `US.NVDA` or `HK.00700`, use it directly.
- If the user gives a Chinese company name, English company name, or common ticker, map it to the matching market-prefixed symbol.
- If the symbol is ambiguous, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.

Common mappings:

| User mention | Standard symbol |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 腾讯 | `HK.00700` |
| 阿里巴巴、阿里 | `HK.09988` |
| 苹果、Apple | `US.AAPL` |
| 特斯拉、Tesla | `US.TSLA` |
| 英伟达、NVIDIA | `US.NVDA` |
| 微软、Microsoft | `US.MSFT` |
| 谷歌、Google、Alphabet | `US.GOOG` |
| 亚马逊、Amazon | `US.AMZN` |
| Meta、脸书、Facebook | `US.META` |
| 台积电、TSM | `US.TSM` |
| 贵州茅台、茅台 | `SH.600519` |
| 宁德时代 | `SZ.300750` |

Ticker inference guidance:

- `NVDA`, `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `MSFT`, `GOOG`, `META` usually mean US stocks, so normalize to `US.NVDA`, `US.AAPL`, `US.TSLA`, `US.MSFT`, `US.GOOG`, `US.META`.
- `00700` by itself is ambiguous in plain text; when the context clearly refers to Tencent, normalize to `HK.00700`.
- If the same company has both HK and US listings and the user does not specify the market, ask a clarifying question.

### 3. Map Derivatives Intent to `analysis_dimensions`

Prefer these canonical `analysis_dimensions` values:

- `warrant_ratio`: Warrant open interest ratio anomaly, HK stocks only
- `warrant_price_distribution`: Warrant open interest price distribution anomaly, HK stocks only
- `option_unusual`: Unusual option trades (large orders)
- `option_volatility`: Option volatility anomaly
- `option_volume_price`: Option volume-price anomaly
- `option_sentiment`: Option sentiment anomaly
- `option_comprehensive`: Option comprehensive signal anomaly

Selection guidance:

- If the user asks about `牛熊证街货比例/牛熊街货比例`, include `warrant_ratio`.
- If the user asks about `重货区/街货价格区间/支撑压力`, include `warrant_price_distribution`.
- If the user asks about `期权大单/大额成交/V/OI/聪明钱押注`, include `option_unusual`.
- If the user asks about `IV/IV percentile/IV rank/HV/波动率溢价`, include `option_volatility`.
- If the user asks about `成交量/持仓量/OI/正股联动`, include `option_volume_price`.
- If the user asks about `PCR/Put Call Ratio/做多做空情绪`, include `option_sentiment`.
- If the user asks about `综合信号/多维背离`, include `option_comprehensive`.
- If the user asks a broad derivatives question and does not narrow scope, omit `analysis_dimensions` and use the full interface.

### 4. Infer `language_id`

Use the following language mapping:

- `0`: Simplified Chinese
- `1`: Traditional Chinese
- `2`: English
- `4`: Thai
- `5`: Japanese

Default strategy:

- Chinese user -> `0`
- Traditional Chinese request -> `1`
- English user -> `2`
- If unclear, default to `0`

### 5. Call the Script

After extracting and normalizing the parameters, call the script with a Python 3 interpreter. Prefer `python3`; only fall back to `python` when `python3` is unavailable. This avoids the common macOS case where `python` is not installed or not on `PATH`.

Script entry:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_derivatives_anomaly.py <STANDARD_SYMBOL> --time-range <DAYS> [--analysis-dimensions ...] [--language-id <ID>] --json
```

Examples:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_derivatives_anomaly.py HK.00700 --time-range 7 --json
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_derivatives_anomaly.py US.NVDA --time-range 7 --analysis-dimensions option_unusual option_volatility --json
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_derivatives_anomaly.py US.AAPL --time-range 7 --analysis-dimensions option_sentiment option_comprehensive --json
```

### 6. Check the Result

- If the script exits successfully, use the returned data to build a structured derivatives anomaly summary.
- If the script returns an error, surface the error message and do not fabricate results.
- If a requested class has no anomaly in the window, explicitly say `No anomaly` or `No anomaly (brief reason)`.
- If the downstream service reports a permission problem or no accessible data, clearly state that the stock or account lacks the required permission.
- If the stock is not Hong Kong listed, warrant-related classes should be marked as `N/A` or `No anomaly`.

## Parameters

### Required

- `stock_symbol`: standard market-prefixed symbol, such as `US.NVDA`, `HK.00700`, `SH.600519`, `SZ.000001`

### Optional

- `time_range`: natural day window, default `7`
- `analysis_dimensions`: list of specific derivatives anomaly dimensions to inspect; omit for full scan
- `language_id`: output language, default `0`

---

## Output Rules

Present the output by anomaly class. The seven classes are:

- `Warrant Open Interest Ratio Anomalies (HK)`
- `Warrant Open Interest Price Distribution Anomalies (HK)`
- `Unusual Option Trades`
- `Option Volatility Anomalies`
- `Option Volume-Price Anomalies`
- `Option Sentiment Anomalies`
- `Option Comprehensive Signal Anomalies`

Formatting rules:

- Always display `Time Range` as an absolute date range in the format `YYYY.M.D - YYYY.M.D`. Calculate the start date from the current date minus `time_range` days (e.g., if today is 2026.4.24 and time_range is 7, write `Time Range: 2026.4.18 - 2026.4.24`).
- Always preserve the class order above.
- **Full scan** (no `analysis_dimensions` specified): always show all 7 class names. Write `No anomaly` for classes with no anomaly. Never omit a class name.
- **Subset request** (user specifies one or more dimensions): show only the classes that correspond to the requested dimensions. Write `No anomaly` for requested classes that have no anomaly. Do not show unrelated classes.
- If multiple abnormal dates or timestamps appear within one class, list them all.
- For `Unusual Option Trades`, when multiple unusual option trades exist in the window, show all of them. Do not collapse them to only the highest-premium trade.
- Keep dates, timestamps, direction, volume, open interest, `V/OI`, premium amount, strike, expiry, percentile, price zone, and interpretation from the tool output.
- Do not merge different anomaly classes into one sentence.
- Warrant-related classes (`Warrant Open Interest Ratio Anomalies (HK)` and `Warrant Open Interest Price Distribution Anomalies (HK)`) apply to Hong Kong stocks only. If the stock is not Hong Kong listed, **omit these two classes entirely** from the output. Do not show them with `N/A`.
- Do not invent thresholds, rankings, or causal explanations beyond the returned content.

---

## Preferred Response Template

```markdown
Time Range: {YYYY.M.D - YYYY.M.D}

Warrant Open Interest Ratio Anomalies (HK):
{anomaly description or "No anomaly"}

Warrant Open Interest Price Distribution Anomalies (HK):
{anomaly description or "No anomaly"}

Unusual Option Trades:
{list every anomaly item by item, or "No anomaly"}

Option Volatility Anomalies:
{anomaly description or "No anomaly"}

Option Volume-Price Anomalies:
{anomaly description or "No anomaly"}

Option Sentiment Anomalies:
{anomaly description or "No anomaly"}

Option Comprehensive Signal Anomalies:
{anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
```

When the user only asks for a subset, keep only the relevant classes.

---

## Behavior Rules

1. Always normalize the user-mentioned stock target into a standard symbol before calling the script.
2. If the target stock is missing, ask a follow-up question.
3. If the market is ambiguous, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.
4. If the user asks a broad derivatives question, omit `analysis_dimensions` and use the full interface.
5. Do not output raw JSON by default when talking to the user, even if the script returns JSON.
6. Do not interpret the result as investment advice or trading guidance.
7. If the downstream service reports a permission issue, state that clearly and do not fabricate analysis.
8. For non-HK stocks, do not force warrant-specific conclusions; use `N/A` or `No anomaly`.

## Example Interpretation Style

```markdown
Time Range: 2026.4.2 - 2026.4.9

Warrant Open Interest Ratio Anomalies (HK):
On 4.3, bull warrant open interest reached 82.2%, higher than 90% of trading days in the past year, indicating more investors are holding bull warrants overnight, reflecting bullish sentiment.
On 4.7, bear warrant open interest reached 17.8%, higher than 90% of trading days in the past year, indicating more investors are holding bear warrants overnight, reflecting bearish sentiment.

Warrant Open Interest Price Distribution Anomalies (HK):
On 4.3, the bull warrant concentration zone sits in the 95.0-100.0 recall-price range, close to the day's close, indicating many investors hold bull warrants in this range and regard this price level as a support.
On 4.7, the largest new additions and the concentration zone for bull warrants are both in the 95.0-100.0 recall-price range, indicating many investors added bull warrants in this range and regard this price level as a support.

Unusual Option Trades:
On 4.4 15:31, a large call option trade occurred with a volume of 1000 contracts, far exceeding the open interest of 130, with a V/OI ratio as high as 15.2, which typically suggests a trader is opening an unusually large new position. The trade involved US$75,000, a strike price of US$10, and an expiry of 2025/09/08.
On 4.6 10:15, a large put option trade occurred with a volume of 800 contracts, far exceeding the open interest of 50, with a V/OI ratio as high as 16.0. The trade involved US$52,000, a strike price of US$165, and an expiry of 2025/05/02.

Option Volatility Anomalies:
On 4.5, implied volatility (IV) is at a historical high and significantly above realized historical volatility (HV), creating a large IV-HV premium. This environment favors option sellers, who can sell options to bet on mean reversion of volatility.
On 4.7, the implied volatility (IV) percentile reached 95, meaning IV is above most days in the past year; time value is high, and option-selling strategies can be used.

Option Volume-Price Anomalies:
On 4.5, option volume rose 52% over the prior period, open interest rose 48%, and the underlying rose 3.5%, which may indicate long capital entering in size and suggests the uptrend may continue. The option market shows significant volume and open-interest concentration near 260, which may become an important support or resistance level.

Option Sentiment Anomalies:
On 4.3, the option Put/Call Ratio percentile reached 89, higher than 89% of trading days in the past year, and rose for 2 consecutive days, with a significant increase in put option activity.

Option Comprehensive Signal Anomalies:
On 4.8, the underlying recently declined sharply, but option implied volatility percentile barely changed; the market has not priced in panic, and historically similar setups have often given rise to rebound opportunities.

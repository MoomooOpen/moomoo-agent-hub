  requests, this skill should be used together with `capital-anomaly` and
  `derivatives-anomaly`. Before calling the script, you must first normalize the
  user-mentioned stock name, Chinese company name, English company name, or
  ticker into a standard symbol such as `US.NVDA` or `HK.00700`.

# Technical Anomaly Skill

Detects technical-analysis anomalies for a specific stock and formats the result as a structured technical anomaly summary.

This skill is for **anomaly detection** rather than a regular technical overview. Focus on concrete abnormal events within the requested window. Do not add extra market commentary, fundamentals-based explanations, or investment advice.

If the user only says a broad request such as `英伟达异动`, `NVDA 异动`, `腾讯有没有异常` and does not specify a dimension, treat it as a bundled anomaly request. In that case, this skill should be used as one of the three default anomaly skills together with `capital-anomaly` and `derivatives-anomaly`.

---

## CLI: Version Update Check

Embed the version check into the skill's **single Bash call**. **Do not create any separate tool call** for the version check.

Start the check as a backgrounded subprocess **before** the business command (e.g. `curl`), then append `wait` **after** the business command to collect the result, all in one invocation:

```bash
moomoo-skills check --quiet 2>/dev/null | grep '^moomoo-technical-anomaly' > /tmp/.moomoo-technical-anomaly-update 2>/dev/null & curl -sG '...' ...; wait; cat /tmp/.moomoo-technical-anomaly-update 2>/dev/null; rm -f /tmp/.moomoo-technical-anomaly-update
```

Based on the `cat` output:

- **No content** (skill is up-to-date, or `moomoo-skills` not installed, or check failed): do not show any upgrade prompt.
- **Has content** (this skill has an update available): append a notice at the **end** of your reply:
  > `moomoo-technical-anomaly` has a new version available. If you agree, I can upgrade it for you right away.

  If the user agrees, run `moomoo-skills upgrade moomoo-technical-anomaly` to perform the upgrade.

If `moomoo-skills` is not installed or the check encounters any error, silently skip without affecting normal skill execution.

**Important**: The version check (write + read) must all be embedded in this single Bash call. Do not produce any additional tool calls.

<!-- This section follows docs/templates/opend-prerequisite.md. Keep it in sync with that template. -->

## Prerequisite: OpenD Must Be Running

This skill depends on moomoo **OpenD** (default `127.0.0.1:11111`) to fetch technical anomaly data. OpenD installation and startup are owned by the peer `install-moomoo-opend` skill — do **not** attempt to detect, install, or start OpenD from inside this skill.

### Pre-flight Check

Silently probe OpenD reachability before the workflow. **Do not announce this step to the user.**

```bash
nc -z 127.0.0.1 11111 && echo ok || echo not-running
```

Behavior:

- **`ok`** — proceed straight to the Workflow. Do not mention OpenD or the pre-flight check; the user does not need to see it.
- **`not-running`** — ask the user for consent in one short, friendly line, e.g.:
  > 该 skill 需要本地 OpenD 服务（127.0.0.1:11111）才能拉取技术异动数据，目前未检测到。需要我现在帮你通过 `/install-moomoo-opend` 安装/启动吗？
  - If the user agrees, hand off by invoking `/install-moomoo-opend`. Resume this skill's Workflow once OpenD is reachable.
  - If the user declines, stop here — do **not** execute `scripts/handle_technical_anomaly.py`.

> **Hard rule**: When OpenD is not running, **do not execute `scripts/handle_technical_anomaly.py` directly**. Hand off to `/install-moomoo-opend` first.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Parse User Input

Extract the following from the user's request:

- `stock_target`: stock code, Chinese stock name, English company name, or ticker explicitly mentioned by the user
- `time_range`: default `7`; if the user says `最近 3 天` / `过去两周` / `last 5 days`, convert it to a natural-day integer
- `indicator_filters`: optional; only extract when the user clearly asks for one or more specific indicators
- `language_id`: infer from the user's language

If the target stock is missing, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.

### 2. Normalize the Stock Target into a Standard Symbol

Before calling the script, convert the user-mentioned stock target into a standard symbol such as `US.NVDA`, `HK.00700`, `SH.600519`, or `SZ.000001`.

Normalization rules:

- If the user already gives a fully qualified symbol like `US.NVDA` or `HK.00700`, use it directly.
- If the user gives a Chinese company name, English company name, or common ticker, map it to the matching market-prefixed symbol.
- If the symbol is ambiguous, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.

Common mappings:

| User mention | Standard symbol |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 腾讯 | `HK.00700` |
| 阿里巴巴、阿里 | `HK.09988` |
| 苹果、Apple | `US.AAPL` |
| 特斯拉、Tesla | `US.TSLA` |
| 英伟达、NVIDIA | `US.NVDA` |
| 微软、Microsoft | `US.MSFT` |
| 谷歌、Google、Alphabet | `US.GOOG` |
| 亚马逊、Amazon | `US.AMZN` |
| Meta、脸书、Facebook | `US.META` |
| 台积电、TSM | `US.TSM` |
| 贵州茅台、茅台 | `SH.600519` |
| 宁德时代 | `SZ.300750` |

Ticker inference guidance:

- `NVDA`, `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `MSFT`, `GOOG`, `META` usually mean US stocks, so normalize to `US.NVDA`, `US.AAPL`, `US.TSLA`, `US.MSFT`, `US.GOOG`, `US.META`.
- `00700` by itself is ambiguous in plain text; when the context clearly refers to Tencent, normalize to `HK.00700`.
- If the same company has both HK and US listings and the user does not specify the market, ask a clarifying question.

### 3. Map Technical Intent to `indicator_filters`

Prefer these canonical `indicator_filters` values when the user clearly asks about a subset:

- `CCI`
- `KDJ`
- `BIAS`
- `AR`
- `BR`
- `VR`
- `PSY`
- `OSC`
- `WMSR`
- `MACD`
- `BOLL`
- `MA`
- `RSI6`
- `RSI12`
- `RSI24`

Selection guidance:

- If the user asks a broad technical question and does not limit indicators, omit `indicator_filters`.
- If the user asks about `MACD`, `金叉`, or `死叉`, include `MACD`.
- If the user asks about `RSI` or `超买超卖`, include `RSI6`, `RSI12`, and `RSI24`.
- If the user asks about `ARBR`, include both `AR` and `BR`.
- If the user asks about `BIAS24` or `乖离率`, include `BIAS`.
- If the user asks about one specific indicator, only pass that indicator's backend filter value when possible.

### 4. Infer `language_id`

Use the following language mapping:

- `0`: Simplified Chinese
- `1`: Traditional Chinese
- `2`: English
- `4`: Thai
- `5`: Japanese

Default strategy:

- Chinese user -> `0`
- Traditional Chinese request -> `1`
- English user -> `2`
- If unclear, default to `0`

### 5. Call the Script

After extracting and normalizing the parameters, call the script with a Python 3 interpreter. Prefer `python3`; only fall back to `python` when `python3` is unavailable. This avoids the common macOS case where `python` is not installed or not on `PATH`.

Script entry:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_technical_anomaly.py <STANDARD_SYMBOL> --time-range <DAYS> [--indicator-filters ...] [--language-id <ID>] --json
```

Examples:

```bash
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_technical_anomaly.py US.NVDA --time-range 7 --json
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_technical_anomaly.py HK.00700 --time-range 7 --indicator-filters MACD RSI6 RSI12 RSI24 --json
PYTHON_BIN="$(command -v python3 || command -v python)" && "$PYTHON_BIN" scripts/handle_technical_anomaly.py SH.600519 --time-range 14 --indicator-filters BOLL MA --json
```

### 6. Check the Result

- If the script exits successfully, use the returned data to build a structured technical-anomaly summary.
- If the script returns an error, surface the error message and do not fabricate results.
- If a requested indicator has no anomaly in the window, explicitly say `No anomaly`.

---

## Parameters

### Required

- `stock_symbol`: standard market-prefixed symbol, such as `US.NVDA`, `HK.00700`, `SH.600519`, `SZ.000001`

### Optional

- `time_range`: natural day window, default `7`
- `indicator_filters`: list of specific technical dimensions to inspect; omit for full scan
- `language_id`: output language, default `0`

---

## Output Rules

Present output by signal class. The response should cover:

- `Candlestick Patterns`
- requested indicator classes, or the full set returned by the interface

Formatting rules:

- Always display `Time Range` as an absolute date range in the format `YYYY.M.D - YYYY.M.D`. Calculate the start date from the current date minus `time_range` days (e.g., if today is 2026.4.24 and time_range is 7, write `Time Range: 2026.4.18 - 2026.4.24`).
- Show each class separately.
- If one class has multiple abnormal dates in the window, list them all in the same class.
- If one class has no anomaly in the window, write `No anomaly`.
- Preserve dates, pattern names, signal direction, probabilities, support/resistance, and interpretation from the tool output.
- Do not merge multiple indicator classes into one sentence.
- Do not invent thresholds or explanations beyond the returned content.
- If the user only asked about a subset of indicators, keep only `Candlestick Patterns` plus the requested indicator classes.

---

## Preferred Response Template

```markdown
Time Range: {YYYY.M.D - YYYY.M.D}

- Candlestick Patterns: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- MACD: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- RSI: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- CCI: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- KDJ: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- BIAS: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- ARBR: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- VR: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- PSY: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- OSC: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- WMSR: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- BOLL: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
- MA: {anomaly description or "No anomaly"}
```

When the user only asks for a subset, keep only `Candlestick Patterns` plus the requested classes.

---

## Behavior Rules

1. Always normalize the user-mentioned stock target into a standard symbol before calling the script.
2. If the target stock is missing, ask a follow-up question.
3. If the market is ambiguous, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.
4. If the user asks a broad technical question, omit `indicator_filters` and use the full interface.
5. Do not output raw JSON by default when talking to the user, even if the script returns JSON.
6. Do not interpret the result as investment advice or trading guidance.
7. Do not invent extra signal explanations beyond what the interface returns.

## Example Interpretation Style

```markdown
Time Range: 2026.4.2-2026.4.9

- Candlestick Patterns: On 4.5, a "bullish continuation triangle" formed, created by gradually lower highs and gradually higher lows, indicating that after forces converged the bulls took control and a breakout may lead to a further advance. The upside probability is 84.5%, support is 2.41, and resistance is 2.52.
- MACD: No anomaly
- RSI: On 4.2, RSI formed a golden cross, suggesting a potential upward leg; on 4.8, RSI formed a death cross, implying a possible downtrend.
- CCI: On 4.3, CCI broke above +100 and entered overbought territory, flagging near-term pullback risk.
- KDJ: On 4.6, the three KDJ lines formed a golden cross below 20, producing an oversold rebound signal.
```

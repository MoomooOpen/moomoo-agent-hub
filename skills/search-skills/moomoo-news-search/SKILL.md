name: moomoo-news-search
description: >-
  Lists the latest moomoo news, articles, announcements, notices, or research reports for ONE
  user-specified stock, company, or ticker. This is a retrieval-only skill: it returns a list of
  items (title + publish time + original URL) sorted by publish time, with a non-investment
  disclaimer. TRIGGER only when the user's request for a single stock explicitly contains a
  news/article/info-style keyword such as "news", "latest news", "recent news", "announcements",
  "notices", "research reports", "articles", "headlines", "updates", "what's happening",
  "新闻", "消息", "最新消息", "最近消息", "近期新闻", "公告", "资讯", "文章", "研报". DO NOT
  TRIGGER on a bare single-stock mention (e.g. "Tesla", "看看 NVDA") that lacks any such keyword
  — that is not an information-listing request. DO NOT TRIGGER on requests to interpret,
  summarize, analyze, or digest news / articles (e.g. "解读最新消息", "interpret the news",
  "give me a digest", "what does this news mean") — that is the job of moomoo-stock-digest.
  This skill only queries and lists information; it does not interpret it.
  When both moomoo-news-search and futu-news-search are installed: preferred for English users;
  Chinese (中文) users should use futu-news-search instead. Users can explicitly say
  "use moomoo" / "用moomoo查" to override. If only this skill is installed, use it for all
  languages.

# moomoo News Search Skill

Searches news, notices, and research reports on the moomoo platform and formats the results as a user-facing news roundup.

**Base URL:** `https://ai-news-search.moomoo.com`

## CLI: Version Update Check

Embed the version check into the skill's **single Bash call**. **Do not create any separate tool call** for the version check.

Start the check as a backgrounded subprocess **before** the business command (e.g. `curl`), then append `wait` **after** the business command to collect the result, all in one invocation:

```bash
moomoo-skills check --quiet 2>/dev/null | grep '^moomoo-news-search' > /tmp/.moomoo-news-search-update 2>/dev/null & curl -sG '...' ...; wait; cat /tmp/.moomoo-news-search-update 2>/dev/null; rm -f /tmp/.moomoo-news-search-update
```

Based on the `cat` output:

- **No content** (skill is up-to-date, or `moomoo-skills` not installed, or check failed): do not show any upgrade prompt.
- **Has content** (this skill has an update available): append a notice at the **end** of your reply:
  > `moomoo-news-search` has a new version available. If you agree, I can upgrade it for you right away.

  If the user agrees, run `moomoo-skills upgrade moomoo-news-search` to perform the upgrade.

If `moomoo-skills` is not installed or the check encounters any error, silently skip without affecting normal skill execution.

**Important**: The version check (write + read) must all be embedded in this single Bash call. Do not produce any additional tool calls.

## Empty Result Fallback

When `futu-news-search` is also installed and this skill's API returns empty results (`data` is empty or `code` is not `0`), automatically retry with `futu-news-search` using the same parameters.

After a successful fallback, inform the user:
- English: "No results found on moomoo. Automatically switched to Futu for this query."
- Chinese: "moomoo 暂无相关结果，已自动切换至富途牛牛平台为您查询。"

If both platforms return empty, or if only this skill is installed (no Futu counterpart) and the API returns empty, show:
- English: "No data available at the moment. Please try again later."
- Chinese: "暂无相关数据，请稍后再试。"

---

## Workflow

### 1. Parse User Input

Extract the following from the user's request:

- `symbol`: stock name, company name, English name, or ticker. Prefer the clearest target explicitly mentioned by the user.
- `size`: default to `10`. If the user asks for more, cap at `50`.
- `lang`: infer from the user's language. Common values are `zh-CN`, `zh-HK`, and `en`.
- `news_type`: if the user explicitly asks for news, notices, or research reports, map it to the matching API parameter.

If the target symbol or company is missing, ask a follow-up question instead of guessing.

### 2. Call the News API

Use `GET /news_search` to fetch the news data.

Required parameters:

- `keyword`
- `size`
- `news_type`: `1` News, `2` Notice, `3` Research. Default to `1` unless the user explicitly asks for notices or research reports.

Optional parameters:

- `lang`
- `sort_type`

Default strategy:

- `keyword` = extracted symbol or company
- `size` = user-specified value, otherwise `10`
- `sort_type` = `2` for time-based sorting
- `news_type` = `1` by default
- If the user explicitly asks for notices, set `news_type=2`
- If the user explicitly asks for research reports, set `news_type=3`

Request example:

```bash
curl -sG 'https://ai-news-search.moomoo.com/news_search' \
  -H 'User-Agent: moomoo-news-search/0.0.2 (Skill)' \
  --data-urlencode 'keyword=Tencent' \
  --data-urlencode 'size=10' \
  --data-urlencode 'news_type=1' \
  --data-urlencode 'lang=en' \
  --data-urlencode 'sort_type=2'
```

### 3. Filter and Sort Results

- After the API call, check whether `code` is `0`. If not, surface the error message and do not fabricate results.
- If the result set is empty, clearly tell the user that no relevant items were found.
- Present the final list in reverse chronological order, newest first.

### 4. Organize the Information

For each item, include:

- title
- publish time
- original link

Publish time requirements:

- Prefer converting `publish_time` into a human-readable local time before replying.
- If the API returns a Unix timestamp in seconds, format it as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`.
- If the API returns a Unix timestamp in milliseconds, convert it first, then format it as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`.
- If the exact timezone is unclear, label it conservatively as `publish time` and do not invent a timezone abbreviation.

### 5. Return Structured Output

Use the following default template:

```markdown
{{symbol}} latest news (sorted by time):

1. {{title_1}}
Publish time: {{publish_time_1}}
URL: {{url_1}}

2. {{title_2}}
Publish time: {{publish_time_2}}
URL: {{url_2}}

...

10. {{title_10}}
Publish time: {{publish_time_10}}
URL: {{url_10}}

The above content is compiled from public information and does not constitute investment advice.

{{platform_source_footer}}
```

Output requirements:

- Always preserve the original article URL.
- Always show the title, publish time, and URL for every returned item.
- Do not show raw JSON by default.
- If fewer items are returned than requested, show only the actual items and do not pad the list.

### 6. Disclaimer

Append the following line at the end of every result:

`The above content is compiled from public information and does not constitute investment advice.`

## API Reference

### Endpoint

- `GET /news_search`

### Parameters

- `keyword`: search keyword, must not be empty
- `size`: number of items to return, must be greater than `0`, maximum `50`
- `news_type`: `1` News, `2` Notice, `3` Research
- `lang`: `zh-CN`, `zh-HK`, `en`
- `sort_type`: `1` by popularity, `2` by time, `3` by attention

### Response Shape

Top-level fields:

- `code`: `0` means success
- `message`: error message
- `data`: result array

Common item fields:

- `news_id`
- `news_type`
- `title`
- `publish_time`
- `url`
- `img_url`

## Behavior Rules

1. When the user asks for "latest news", "recent updates", or a news roundup, default to `10` items + `sort_type=2` + `news_type=1`.
2. When the user asks specifically for notices, prefer `news_type=2`. For research reports, prefer `news_type=3`.
3. If the user provides only a company name, use it directly as `keyword`. If the user provides a ticker, try the ticker first, and if needed retry once with a more natural company-name query.
4. Do not interpret the results as investment advice, trading signals, or target-price guidance.
5. Do not invent sources, timestamps, or links.
6. If `publish_time` is present, include it in every item rather than omitting it.
7. Do not omit `news_type` in default requests, because default behavior should focus on actual news items only.

## Example

```markdown
Tencent latest news (sorted by time):

1. Tencent short-selling volume surged 266% during the March Hong Kong market pullback
Publish time: 2026-03-31 09:30:00
URL: https://...

2. Tencent completed buybacks for three consecutive days, totaling about HKD 900 million
Publish time: 2026-03-30 18:12:00
URL: https://...

3. Southbound funds posted net buying in Tencent for three straight days
Publish time: 2026-03-30 15:48:00
URL: https://...

Source: moomoo | English queries default to moomoo; Chinese queries default to Futu. Say "use futu" to switch.
```

## Security

- Do not expose internal authentication details, cookies, tokens, or gateway internals in the reply.
- Use `--data-urlencode` for `keyword` so Chinese text and special characters are encoded correctly.
